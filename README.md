## Description
[My Website!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-02/)  
For this week's homework, I created a web application from scratch.  

To start off, I retrieved a template provided by w3schools.  
Then, I made changes to it so that it'll create a layout in the way I wanted it to be.  
Afterwards, I added content and styled the website using CSS to make it visually appealing.   
I worked to make the code neater and added numerous comments so that I won't lose track in the process of building and styling elements. 
I also included a favicon next to the title of my webpage to make it stand out from others. 

The purpose of building this project was to showcase my skills and talents to employers.

One thing I learned for sure during this whole process is that things get much more complicated and difficult when starting off with an already existing code.  
The reason behind this is that there's just so much going on in the code that I have not been made aware of. Therefore, it gets extremely confusing when it comes to things getting over-ridden each other.  
From now on, even if I'd get stuck building a specific component, I'll make sure to utilize resources like frameworks, rather than relying on a template. 

## Installation
The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:
  1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
  2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
  3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
  4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website. 

## Usage
To use my website, click on one of the links in the navigation bar that will direct you to the corresponding section.   
When you click on the image in the section about my work, you will be directed to that deployed application.  
Furthermore, you can click on one of the social media icons on the bottom of the page and it will navigate you to the webpage in another tab.
