# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Description
[My Password Generator Website!](https://kroh1031.github.io/week-03/)  
For this week's homework, I created a password generator using JavaScript.  
The purpose of building this project was to create a strong password that provides greater security to users.

Before I started, I made sure I fully understood what the starter code was providing me with so I could add to it accordingly.  
Then, I added a generatePassword function as this is where I'd be doing all my work.  
Afterwards I added prompts, if else statements, and for loops to validate the input and generate a random password.   

One thing I learned during this whole process is that you need to break everything down into baby steps in order for the website to function the way you want it to.

## Installation
The steps that I took in order to deploy my website:
  1. First, I used the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.
  2. Then, I navigated into my GitHub repository's Settings tab.
  3. From the settings page, I scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section and selected the master branch as my source.
  4. After doing so, I was finally able to get the URL for my now deployed website. 

## Usage
To use my website, click the button to generate a password
and select the length of the password and which criteria to include in the password.
The length of the password can only be between 8 and 128 characters and at least one character type must be selected.
When all prompts are answered, a password is generated that matches the selected criteria and the generated password will be written to the page.
